THE LAST THING I TOUCHED:
**************************************************************************************
Week of 3/3/14
- Ported to VS2013.
- Submitted into Git @ https://github.com/poodull/PinBrain.git

Week of 10/15/12
- Fixed Items for sound
- Fixed CMM.swf for bonus multiplier and magic icon
- playing around with lighting effects enums idea... not sure i like it.

Week of 10/22/12
- Moved Switch handling to SwitchManager and assigned Actions from Modes.
- Added TrophyRoomMode to handle the captured ball and timed trophy bonus.
- Added Ball Search movie and ball check at the start of a game.
- I broke normal play once a player gets to trophy room(mode).
- Flash: Attract change STARTPRESSED API command to GOTOTITLE.
- Flash: Attract now loops to Title n times before going back to start.
- Flash: Attract Left/Right goes to Title/HighScores.

Week of 11/05/12
- Put timing logic into Trophy mode.
- Added SwitchManager.RotateCross.
Week of 11/30/12
- Testing speed while reading serial
- Why isn't zombie death sound working?!?!

Work on Trophy Mode next. It's not done.
Or Fixing End of ball so it doesn't rely on the trough being full.
Or Extracting Character Select from Normal Play mode.
Or Moving Trophy mode to Boss mode (which contains trophy) and prepping multiball

**************************************************************************************
NEW IDEAS:
**************************************************************************************
Flash work:
- Attract needs "CREDITS {0}" in PRESS START screen
    - if CREDITS == 0 PRESS START should read INSERT COIN
    - if CREDITS == -1 CREDITS {0} should read FREE PLAY
- Trophy needs timer countdown animation to put the ball in the CenterScoop

WARP:
- I need a command line GOD mode.  One thing I'll need a lot of is the ability to warp
to a specific level.  like WARP 5:2 will send me to level 5, room 2.  More useful will
be WARP 5:B for boss room.  
    - This feature, if paired with an animation, could be a merchant award.

TEST
- It would be useful to allow TEST mode to load a new maze like Boss attack or Ball Lock
that allows for easy testing of a mode or feature while using the actual game logic.

STACKING MODES
- I need to be able to stack modes so that switches can be handled properly based on a mode
that is active and animations work as they should.  An example would be mulitball into 
Boss mode.  Perhaps I can allow for a list of sub modes in NormalPlay and before any switch
is handled, it's passed to this submode with a 'Handled' return flag.  That way only one
sub mode handles the switch, while Normal Mode is still the only thing registered on 
Switch Manager.  this would hopefully eliminate GameManager.CurrentInputMode

BROKEN/DEFFERRED
**************************************************************************************
Boss battle?

If you die and restart a room, the award is regenerated.  is that ok?  light lock?

Trough Manager is crap.  Particularly how it handles balls on field and balldrains
**************************************************************************************





**************************************************************************************
WHAT I'M WORKING ON NOW/LAST:
**************************************************************************************
IN GAME:
- Player object extracted from PlayerStatus.  PlayerStatus -> PlayerManager. (10/18/12 10% halted for now.. rather complex)
- Trophy Mode needs to handle ball loss and timer.  (10/22/12 40%)


RANDOM THOUGHTS:
- Maybe PlayerStatus should have derrived types based on the chosen player... so that the logic for each player is contained in the derrived class.
    - that way playerStatus is more like PlayerManager which contains an array of players
    - need a fast, threadsafe way to get playerbase data into a playerstatus bean.

- How do I handle game adjustments?  It's hard enough switched based on character type, but to also account for adjustments per feature?
    - especially for something like timers (complete ITEM withing x seconds?)

-Do I need to abstract a MotorManager and interface incase the SolenoidArduino can't handle extra pins?
